This is a personal interest project implementing several neural networks. I started this project
while I was learning these stuffs and I think I can have better understanding through coding them. 
Specifically, mainly based on Python and Numpy, I implemented MLP,
RNN, LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM, neural attention models as well as some nonstandard
networks and some evaluation metrics for classification, clustering and ranking problems
