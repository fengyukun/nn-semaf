# Neural network based frame labeling (nnfl)

This is a personal interest project implementing several neural networks with one application on
semantic frame labeling/identification.

I started this project while I was learning these stuffs and I think I can have better
understanding through coding them from scratch.  Specifically, mainly based on Python and Numpy, I
implemented MLP, RNN, LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM, neural attention models as well as some nonstandard
networks and some evaluation metrics for classification, clustering and ranking problems.
